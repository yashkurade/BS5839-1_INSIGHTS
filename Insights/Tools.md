# Potential Tools

During my training and hands-on experience, I identified a few tools that could enhance understanding and implementation of BS5839-1:

- **Device placement assistance**  
  While placing numerous devices in AutoCAD, I realized it would be very helpful to have a tool that can **assist or validate device placement**, indicating whether each device complies with protocol requirements. This could save time and reduce errors during the design phase.  

- **Fire simulation tools**  
  I would like to explore tools that can **simulate fire scenarios** to test systems designed virtually. Such simulations would help evaluate the effectiveness of layouts, detector placements, and overall system response before actual installation.
