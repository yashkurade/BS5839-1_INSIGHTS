# Commissioning

Commissioning is the stage where the installed fire detection and alarm system is tested, verified, and made ready for operation. Based on BS5839-1, key points include:

- **Functional Testing of Devices**  
  Each detector, call point, and alarm device should be individually tested to ensure it operates correctly and communicates with the control panel.  

- **System Integration Checks**  
  Confirm that all devices are properly integrated with the panel, alarms, and any other linked systems. This ensures coordinated responses during real events.  

- **Verification Against Design**  
  Check that devices are installed according to the approved design, layout, and standard protocols. Any deviations should be documented and corrected.  

- **Signal Path and Response Time Testing**  
  Ensure that signals from detectors and call points reach the panel promptly and that alarms are triggered without delay.  

- **Documentation and Handover**  
  Maintain complete records of tests, adjustments, and observations. This becomes the official commissioning report and is crucial for future maintenance and audits.  

- **Lessons Learned from Field Implementation**  
  During commissioning, practical constraints often appear. Documenting issues like inaccessible devices, unexpected obstructions, or adjustments needed helps improve future designs.
