# Field Perspective

From a practical, on-site perspective, I observed several important points about implementing BS5839-1:

- **Device layout vs real-world constraints**  
  Designing device placement according to theory and protocols is one thing, but actual site conditions often differ. Physical constraints, existing infrastructure, and human factors can affect placement. It is important to adapt layouts while ensuring compliance with the standard.  

- **Adaptable design**  
  Needs on site may change at any time. Therefore, system designs should be flexible enough to accommodate modifications without compromising safety or protocol compliance.  

- **Document updates promptly**  
  Any changes, updates, or deviations from the original design should be documented immediately. This prevents confusion later and helps avoid potential hazards or miscommunication between teams.
