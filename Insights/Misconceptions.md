# Misunderstood Parts

While studying BS5839-1, there were a few things that initially confused me, but I later understood their rationale:

- **L1, L2, and other coverage categories**  
  At first, I wondered why the standard fragments areas into categories like L1 and L2, especially when L1 coverage already protects the entire building. Later I realized that full coverage is not always necessary — certain areas may require higher priority due to risk or occupancy. This explains why different levels of protection exist, balancing safety and practicality.  

- **Placement of smoke vs heat detectors**  
  I initially questioned why smoke detectors are sometimes installed lower than heat detectors, since smoke rises to the ceiling. I learned that smoke movement can be influenced by airflow, ventilation, or air conditioning, and may not always reach the ceiling quickly. Heat detectors, on the other hand, rely on temperature rise, so proper placement ensures accurate detection and helps prevent false alarms.
